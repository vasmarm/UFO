# UFO

Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

>**Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search**


Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.


Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.



>**Level 2: Multiple Search Categories**


Complete all of Level 1 criteria.
Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:



- date/time
- city
- state
- country
- shape
